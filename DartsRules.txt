A square 5x5 dart board will be used for darts thrown by the player(s).
In both game options the player(s) must get correctly the positions of the dart board.
Whoever gains the position first wins with their score presented at the end of the game.
The concept is a deduction system for up to 25 chances.
Turns keep going until a score of 25 is fully deducted.
Spaces are randomized with a number generator. Logic of guessing the X and Y coordinates are used.
